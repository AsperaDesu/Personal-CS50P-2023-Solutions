# Harvard CS50P 2023 ‚Äì Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the **CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Programming with Python (2023)** problem sets, offered by **Harvard University**.

## üìò Overview
The problem sets cover core programming concepts such as:

- Variables, Conditionals, and Loops  
- Functions and Scopes  
- Exceptions and File I/O  
- Unit Testing  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Regular Expressions and Libraries  

Each folder corresponds to one week of the course, following the original CS50P structure.

All solutions were written in **Python 3.10+**.  
To run any file:

```bash
python filename.py
```

## üß© Notes

These solutions are for learning and reference purposes only.
I strongly encourage others to attempt the problems themselves before viewing any code.
